# muffin.css
Some css Framework i'v been working on for a while.

It is meant for 'true' responsive fullscreen applications/websites that stay loyal even when the screen size changes.
It is also meant to work on old devices, without javascript, scratching at some of the edges of what CSS can do.
I've been working with techniques like this for a longer time now and wanted something stable, re-usable for multiple purposes like actual websites, blogs, or anything.

It is a work in the progress, i put everything into it i learned so far in UX design and front-end web development.

It is not stable to use currently as it may change all the time and get new components etc.

Use on your own risk, get inspired, push, comment, star and crap if you like to.

This here is more a doc for me myself than anything else.

It uses invalid HTML tags, which work in legacy, tested browsers like Android, iOS, Chrome, etc. but may not fully work in every browser.

Current example / working dir: https://codepen.io/Blubbll/full/oEWaLP/

It is basically a fixed grid with custom html components following this design.

I am inspired by other codepen pens and Google's material design and flat design in general.
